# Architecture Validation Checklist

## Coherence Validation

- [ ] Decision Compatibility: Do all technology choices work together without conflicts?
- [ ] Decision Compatibility: Are all versions compatible with each other?
- [ ] Decision Compatibility: Do patterns align with technology choices?
- [ ] Decision Compatibility: Are there any contradictory decisions?
- [ ] Pattern Consistency: Do implementation patterns support the architectural decisions?
- [ ] Pattern Consistency: Are naming conventions consistent across all areas?
- [ ] Pattern Consistency: Do structure patterns align with technology stack?
- [ ] Pattern Consistency: Are communication patterns coherent?
- [ ] Structure Alignment: Does the project structure support all architectural decisions?
- [ ] Structure Alignment: Are boundaries properly defined and respected?
- [ ] Structure Alignment: Does the structure enable the chosen patterns?
- [ ] Structure Alignment: Are integration points properly structured?

## Requirements Coverage Validation

- [ ] Epic/Feature Coverage: Does every epic have architectural support?
- [ ] Epic/Feature Coverage: Are all user stories implementable with these decisions?
- [ ] Epic/Feature Coverage: Are cross-epic dependencies handled architecturally?
- [ ] Epic/Feature Coverage: Are there any gaps in epic coverage?
- [ ] Functional Requirements: Does every functional requirement have architectural support?
- [ ] Functional Requirements: Are all FR categories fully covered by architectural decisions?
- [ ] Functional Requirements: Are cross-cutting FRs properly addressed?
- [ ] Functional Requirements: Are there any missing architectural capabilities?
- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements: Are performance requirements addressed architecturally?
- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements: Are security requirements fully covered?
- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements: Are scalability considerations properly handled?
- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements: Are compliance requirements architecturally supported?

## Implementation Readiness Validation

- [ ] Decision Completeness: Are all critical decisions documented with versions?
- [ ] Decision Completeness: Are implementation patterns comprehensive enough?
- [ ] Decision Completeness: Are consistency rules clear and enforceable?
- [ ] Decision Completeness: Are examples provided for all major patterns?
- [ ] Structure Completeness: Is the project structure complete and specific?
- [ ] Structure Completeness: Are all files and directories defined?
- [ ] Structure Completeness: Are integration points clearly specified?
- [ ] Structure Completeness: Are component boundaries well-defined?
- [ ] Pattern Completeness: Are all potential conflict points addressed?
- [ ] Pattern Completeness: Are naming conventions comprehensive?
- [ ] Pattern Completeness: Are communication patterns fully specified?
- [ ] Pattern Completeness: Are process patterns (error handling, etc.) complete?
